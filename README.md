# GeneratePatterns-ReverseString-ValidatePassword
This project was one of the first assignments for my C# programming class (BCS-426-Lab1) at Farmingdale State College. 
The goal of this assignment was for students to get an introduction to C# and ASP.NET, 
so we were prompted to generate and spot patterns in strings according to specifications. 
My program utilizes a looping menu to allow the user to select what feature they would like to use. 
This was useful for selecting which pattern to generate such as a triangle or diamond made up of a specified character and to a given size. 
Other features available can reverse a string of numbers, as well as validate a password string to meet character requirements. 
This was a solo assignment made using C# and ASP.NET
